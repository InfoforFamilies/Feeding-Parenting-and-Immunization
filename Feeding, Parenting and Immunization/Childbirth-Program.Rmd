Congratulations on your newborn! We know this is an exciting yet difficult time for new parents. Due to COVID-19, many of the regular community resources for new parents are not accessible or have limited availability, such as lactation consultant services, pump rentals, and community supports.  We understand that and have put together a few resources for you. 

In an effort to protect patients, families and staff, the Breastfeeding Drop-in Clinic at QCH is open, but by appointment only. The appointment times allow for proper distancing in the waiting room and in the clinic as per COVID guidelines. While you are in hospital, our Registered Lactation Consultants are available to families for assistance. Please use the following link for more information about booking an appointment for the Breastfeeding Support Clinic   https://www.qch.on.ca/OutpatientResources
